    <body><p>Rancho Conejo is located on a dozen acres in the Ozark Mountains of Northwest Arkansas.
        We started organic gardening as soon as we found our new home here in 2014.
        After acquiring six dogs from the local shelter as (less-than-effective) “ranch hands,” 
        we set about learning to keep bees. It has been an amazing process realizing 
        how important bees are to our existence, and we are humbled to be able to 
        provide a home for some local wild swarms that have taken up residence in our 
        hand-crafted Warré hives. We have grown to respect and love these beautiful creatures, 
        and we think it’s reflected in the quality and unique flavor of our honey. 
        We hope you love it as much as we do!</p>
